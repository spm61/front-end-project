# Hangman JS Game
Team Project for first phase of bootcamp.  Creates an interactive Front End Application. 
We decided to implement a Hangman game.  

# User-Story
As a player, I want to play an online game of Hangman.
As a player who plays the Hangman game, I want to be presented with a random word to guess.
As a player, I want the word to fill in when I choose a letter or draw a step of the Hangman if I guess wrong.
As a player, I want to win when I successfully solve the word or lose when the hangman is drawn.

# Acceptance Criteria
It is done when a random word is generated at the start of a new game.
It is done when recent scores are saved at the end of a game.
It is done when the game draws the hangman on incorrect guesses and ends the game when its drawn.
It is done when, if the word is correctly entered, the game declares a winning state and then ends the game.
It is done when, at the end of a game, the user can start a new game.
It is done when the user enters a guess by pressing a letter key on the keyboard.

# Future Developement (or, things we'd do if we had more time).
User can specify the length of the word.
The word's definition can be displayed to give the user a hint.
The user can guess the entire word at once.
